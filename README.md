# discord.js-heroku

> An in-depth guide on deploying your
[Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js) bot on Heroku

**Tip:** This guide also applies to any Node.js libraries for the Discord API,
such as [discord.io](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io),
[eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris), and
[discordie](https://github.com/qeled/discordie).

## ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE

Unfortunately, the [free Heroku plan](https://www.heroku.com/free) will be completely discontinued starting on **November 28th, 2022**. As a result, this guide is henceforth deprecated.

I am not familiar with other any reputable alternatives that can host bots for free, and thus cannot recommend switching to any in particular; if you are familiar with one, you are free to fork this repository and make the appropriate changes to this guide.

Below is the original text of the guide preserved for posterity, especially for individuals that plan on continuing to host on paid Heroku plans. Do note that although the general setup process remains correct, some aspects of the guide are outdated (i.e. minimum Node version, sample `index.js`), so please take that into account when referencing this guide in the future.

Finally, I'd like to thank you, the guide readers, for your continuous support over the past five years. When I first started this guide, I was a high school student that couldn't host on a dedicated server because I lacked disposable income, so I wrote the guide to help [discord.js support server](https://discord.gg/djs) users in a similar situation; I never expected it to be starred and forked over a hundred times. Because of this guide, my GitHub username also shows up over a thousand times in [various `package.json` files on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=synicalsyntax&type=code) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52929264/parse-error-expected-another-key-value-pair/52955106); it's been really gratifying to see how many hobbyist projects I've been able to kickstart through it.

Best of luck to all in the rest of their programming journeys.

## About

### About Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a cloud platform that offers services to
host and deploy your web applications in multiple languages, such as Node.js,
Ruby, Python, Java, PHP, and Go.

It's optimal for hosting a bot for several reasons:

* **Free** — Heroku offers a free hosting plan, so you don't have to pay at all!

    If you plan on using the free hosting plan, you should note the following
    limitations:

    * **Limit of 550 hours per month** across the applications on your account.

    This means that once your apps have been deployed on Heroku for over 550
    hours, they will go to sleep, and you can't restart them until the start of
    the next month when your hours are received.

    Luckily, Heroku bumps the limit to **1000 hours per month** if you [verify
    your account](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification) by
    adding a credit card to your account, so this limitation won't matter if you
    do so.

    To help colliding with this limitation, I also recommend creating a separate
    Heroku account for hosting your bot so your other applications don't take up
    its hosting time.

* **Easily deployable** — You can configure Heroku in two ways that allow you
to easily deploy any changes made to your bot:

    * **Heroku CLI** — With the power of Git, `git push heroku master` is all
    you'll ever need to do with Heroku's easy-to-use command line interface.

    * **Integrate your app with GitHub** for automatic deployment of your bot
    whenever your configured GitHub repository is updated.

* **Online web and command line interface** — If you're not comfortable with using
your command line interface, you can access your app through Heroku's web
interface, and vice versa.

### About this guide

A lot of people have run into difficulties while trying to set up their bot on
Heroku, however. This guide was created to help resolve some of those issues.

Some additional notes that you should keep in mind as you follow this guide:

* In the directions throughout this guide, `$` denotes a Bash prompt
and should not be included while entering commands in the command line prompt.

* The main script of the bot will be referred to as `index.js`.

* This guide is primarily uses the Heroku CLI (rather than the web interface) to
interact with Heroku.

* It's possible to run your bot in parallel with a web server! See the [web](https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku/tree/web) branch for
more information.

### About this repository

This repository also contains several example files mentioned in this guide for
you to use as references, including:

* `package.json` ([link](https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku/blob/master/package.json))

* `Procfile` ([link](https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku/blob/master/Procfile))

* `.gitignore` ([link](https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku/blob/master/.gitignore))

* `index.js` ([link](https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku/blob/master/index.js))

    This file contains the source code for the **Discord.js Heroku** bot on my
    [bot testing server](https://discord.gg/PJCDeXQ), which serves as a demo of
    the instructions in this guide; it utilizes Heroku's [environment
    variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have:

* [installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) Node
(version >= v8.0.0) and npm (you better have, also how would you even know that
your bot works? <img
src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/273981728899465216.png"
style="vertical-align:middle"  width="24">)

* [installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
and
[configured](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
Git on your local machine

* created a GitHub
[account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/)
and [repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/), if you're
planning on automatically deploying your bot from GitHub

* [installed](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) the Heroku CLI

* changed your directory path to the root directory of your bot (the one where
your bot's files and scripts are located in):

    ```sh
    $ cd path/to/directory
    ```

### Creating a `package.json` file

In order for Heroku to deploy your bot, you need a file called `package.json`
that tells Heroku what dependencies to install to run your app.

If you haven't created one already, you can run `npm init` in the root directory
of your bot to have an interactive prompt-based setup of your `package.json`
file.

The process should look like this (you push the `Enter`/`Return` key to save
your answer and move on to the next prompt):

```
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

}


Is this ok? (yes)
```

#### Installing your dependencies

Running `npm init` won't tell specify your bot's dependencies in `package.json`,
but you can do so by running

```sh
$ npm install <pkg> --save
```

This command will install the dependency with the name `<pkg>` in the
`node_modules` folder while automatically adding the dependency to
`package.json`. For example, `$ npm install discord.js --save` will install and
add the `discord.js` dependency to `package.json`.

You'll need to do this for all the dependencies that your bot uses, since
missing dependencies in your `package.json` file will cause problems when you
try to deploy to Heroku; packages installed on your system won't be installed on
Heroku unless you specify them in `package.json`.

#### Specifying the versions of Node and npm

You need to define the version of Node.js and npm that will be used to run your
application on Heroku in your `package.json` file. You should always specify a
Node version that matches the runtime you’re developing and testing with.

To find your version of Node, run:
```sh
$ node -v
```

To find you version of npm, run:
```sh
$ npm -v
```

You can now add these versions to your `package.json` file like in the example below:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "8.x",
  "npm": "*"
},
```

Your `package.json` file should now look something like:

```json
{
  "name": "discord.js-heroku",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An in-depth guide on deploying your Discord.js bot on Heroku",
  "main": "index.js",
  "engines": {
      "node": "8.x",
      "npm": "*"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku.git"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "heroku",
    "discord.js"
  ],
  "author": "synicalsyntax",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku#readme"
}
```

#### Specifying a start script

What's the command that you enter in your command line interface to start your
bot? If your bot's main scripts are located in `index.js`, chances are that
command is `$ node index.js`. That command will also serve as the start script,
which is what Heroku will run when it tries to start your bot.

To specify the start command, you need to add it to your `package.json` file
under the `scripts` field, like the example below:

```json
{
  "name": "discord.js-heroku",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An in-depth guide on deploying your Discord.js bot on Heroku",
  "main": "index.js",
  "engines": {
      "node": "8.x",
      "npm": "*"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku.git"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "heroku",
    "discord.js"
  ],
  "author": "synicalsyntax",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/synicalsyntax/discord.js-heroku#readme"
}
```

### Creating a `Procfile`

By default, Heroku looks for a
[Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) to determine what
processes are run by the [dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos)
(or containers) of your app.

You need to create a file named `Procfile` at the root directory of your
application with the following contents:

```
worker: npm start
```

### Creating a `.gitignore` file

You should exclude some files from being checked in to Git/version control by
specifying them in a `.gitignore` file. One example of files that should be
excluded are those in the `node_modules` folder; not doing so results in a build
process that takes *forever* because the build cache can't be utilized.

Download this Node `.gitignore`
[template](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore) from
your buddies at GitHub and include it in the root directory of your bot.

### Committing your files

In order to deploy your application to Heroku, you need to stage and commit your
files with Git.

First, initialize an empty Git repository with the `git init` command.

```sh
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/discord.js-heroku/.git/
```

Next, run the `git status` command to make sure that you won't be accidentally
checking in any extraneous files to Git (such as your `node_modules` folder).

```sh
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore
	LICENSE
	Procfile
	README.md
	index.js
	package-lock.json
	package.json
```

If you see `node_modules` or any extraneous files under the **Untracked files**
section, make sure to add them to your `.gitignore` file like we discussed
in the previous step before moving on.

Once you're ready to commit your changes, run the following command to stage and
commit all of your files:

```sh
$ git add . && git commit -m 'Initial commit'
[master (root-commit) 4a7552a] Initial commit
 7 files changed, 660 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 LICENSE
 create mode 100644 Procfile
 create mode 100644 README.md
 create mode 100644 index.js
 create mode 100644 package-lock.json
 create mode 100644 package.json
```

To double check if you successfully made your commit or not, you can use the
`git log` command to review your Git commit history.

```sh
$ git log
commit 4a7552a7292c4faf23bdfbc6135ef3e13ed31487 (HEAD -> master)
Author: synicalsyntax
Date:   Sat Apr 14 11:11:49 2018 -0700

    Initial commit
```

### Creating a Heroku application

If you haven't done so already, [sign up](https://signup.heroku.com) for a
Heroku account and verify it.

To create a new Heroku application, login with your Heroku account credentials
when you run:

```sh
$ heroku login
```

Now create an app with name `your-app-name` by running:

```sh
$ heroku create your-app-name
```

If `your-app-name` is available, Heroku will create an app under that name.

Finally, add a Git remote named `heroku` pointing to Heroku:

```sh
$ git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git
$ git remote -v
heroku	https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git (fetch)
heroku	https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git (push)
```

### Integrating Heroku with GitHub

**Note:** This step is required if you plan on automatically deploying your bot
every time you push changes to a GitHub repository.

#### Adding a Git remote

To push new commits and changes to a GitHub repository, you'll need to first
[add a Git remote](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote/) by
running:

```sh
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

If your remote was added successfully, running `$ git remote -v` should give you
the following output:

```sh
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git (push)
```

You can now push commits to your GitHub repository by running:

```sh
$ git push origin master
```

#### Automatically deploying with GitHub

Follow Heroku's guide on [integration with
GitHub](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) and enable
[automatic
deploys](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#automatic-deploys)
to deploy your bot whenever you push to your GitHub repository.

### Testing your setup

**Note:** This step is not required (especially if you haven't downloaded
the Heroku CLI), but it's highly recommended.

You should build your application locally to test if you've set up it correctly.

You can do so by running `npm install` to install all your dependencies and then
starting your app locally by running:

```sh
$ heroku local
```

The Heroku CLI will now run your app at http://localhost:5000/; if no errors are
encountered, you're on the right track!

## Deploying your app

If you're reading this part of the guide, you should have:

* developed a functioning Discord bot

* setup your repository for Heroku deployment


If all goes well, you can now deploy your app to Heroku by running:

```sh
$ git push heroku master
```

If the app is deployed successfully, congratulations! You've finished setting
up, deploying to, and hosting your bot on Heroku!

If you have some questions/feedback about this guide, you can message me on
Discord at **synicalsyntax#9944**. Hope you found this guide helpful! :)
